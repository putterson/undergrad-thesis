\chapter{Conclusion}
We have found that it is possible to quickly, efficiently and accurately match large binary codes in large databases of codes generated through ORB to perform fast image matching. This technique improves upon using hashing techniques on real valued descriptors to generate binary codes as with larger datasets these hashing techniques lose effectiveness in mapping real codes to binary codes, while binary codes generated by ORB do not suffer this degradation. As well this technique allows matching of these long binary descriptors in sub-linear times in respect to the database size. The Multi-Index hashing technique ensures that as database sizes grow the query time for these databases will increase with the square root of the size of the databases while using ORB ensures that as the database size grows the matching effectiveness of the codes will not drastically decrease. This research shows that there is promise in using natively generated binary descriptors for matching images quickly and that with current technology this technique can compete with current effective techniques.
