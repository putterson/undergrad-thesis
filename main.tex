%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

%% For "undergraduate theses", uncomment the following line and 
%% add any other options that you may require 
\documentclass{uoit-thesis}

%% For "graduate thesis" use the 'grad' option, uncomment the
%% following line and any other options that you may require
%% \documentclass[grad]{uoit-thesis}

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

\input{plotting}

%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% You should put all of your `\newcommand', `\newenvironment', and
%% `\newtheorem's (in other words, all the global definitions that
%% you will need throughout your thesis) in a separate file and use
%% "\input{filename}" to input it here.


%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
We have combined the Multi-Index Hashing technique with large binary descriptors to provide fast, accurate image matching in large datasets. We have found that 256 bit rotated BRIEF descriptors generated with the oriented FAST feature detector can be matched in sub-linear time. We have shown this technique to be effective for databases of up to 10 million codes generated from 25,000 images. This research shows that accurate matching of images is possible for large image datasets while maintaining speed and space efficiency by coupling natively generated binary image descriptors with the Multi-Index Hashing technique.
%% ***   Put your Abstract here.   ***
%% (At most 150 words for M.Sc. or 350 words for Ph.D.)
\end{abstract}

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage
%% and the table of contents starts with \clearpage.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\begin{dedication}
%% ***   Put your Dedication here.   ***
%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% you should put an explicit \newpage between them.

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\begin{acknowledgements}
%% ***   Put your Acknowledgements here.   ***
%\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\begingroup
\hypersetup{linkcolor=black}
\tableofcontents
\endgroup

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed.
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document)
%\listoffigures

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page.     %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% ***   Include chapter files here.   ***
\include{introduction}
\include{methodology}
\include{results}
\include{discussion}
\include{conclusions}

%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% ***   Set the bibliography style.   ***
%% (change according to your preference)
\bibliographystyle{plain}
%% ***   Set the bibliography file.   ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change if needed)
\bibliography{thesis}

%% ***   NOTE   ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file
%% and `\include' or `\input' it here).
